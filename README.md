# Amity
Repo for our 2017 Technovation submission. We created a cultural sharing app in Android Studio called Amity.

Amity serves to bridge the physical and cultural distance between people across the world. Read other usersâ€™ stories by clicking a country on the globe, and share your own experiences, from personal anecdotes, to photos and videos, to recipes. Like and bookmark your favorite posts to easily view them later.
In creating a platform for people everywhere to view different cultures, Amity hopes to promote a feeling of friendship, or amity, among people of all cultures.
